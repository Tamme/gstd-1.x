Description: GStreamer Daemon 
  GStreamer Daemon, also called gstd, is a GStreamer framework for controlling audio and video streaming using TCP connection messages. Qt applications, web interfaces, and GStreamer element test suites show different ways the framework can be utilized. GStreamer Daemon is gst-launch on steroids where you can create a GStreamer pipeline, play, pause, change speed, skip around, and even change element parameter settings all while the pipeline is active.
